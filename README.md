# syncro-menu-modifier
 Simple Chrome/Edge Chrome Extension to allow more menu items in Syncro Portal.
 
 To Change how many items are shown, change the maxItems in the content.js
 
 Although I can't test for RepairShopR, it should work the same.
 Just modify the "matches" section in the manifest.json file to reflect the repairshopr Portal URL.
